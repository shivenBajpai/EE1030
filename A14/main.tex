\item A cylindrical bar with $200 \, \text{mm}$ diameter is being turned with a tool having geometry $0^\circ - 9^\circ - 7^\circ - 8^\circ - 15^\circ - 30^\circ - 0.05 \, \text{inch}$ (Coordinate system, ASA) resulting in a cutting force $F_{c1}$. If the tool geometry is changed to $0^\circ - 9^\circ - 7^\circ - 8^\circ - 15^\circ - 0^\circ - 0.05 \, \text{inch}$ (Coordinate system, ASA) and all other parameters remain unchanged, the cutting force changes to $F_{c2}$. Specific cutting energy $(\text{in J/mm}^3)$ is $U_c = U_0 t_1^{-0.4}$, where $U_0$ is the specific energy coefficient, and $t_1$ is the uncut thickness in mm. The value of percentage change in cutting force $F_{c2}$ i.e. $\left( \frac{F_{c2} - F_{c1}}{F_{c1}} \right) \times 100$, is \ldots\ldots \ (round off to one decimal place). \hfill (GATE ME 2020)

\item There are two identical shaping machines $S_1$ and $S_2$. In machine $S_2$, the width of the workpiece is increased by $10\%$ and the feed is decreased by $10\%$, with respect to that of $S_1$. If all other conditions remain the same then the ratio of total time per pass in $S_1$ and $S_2$ will be \ldots\ldots \ (round off to one decimal place). \hfill (GATE ME 2020)

\item
Bars of $250 \, \text{mm}$ length and $25 \, \text{mm}$ diameter are to be turned on a lathe with a feed of $0.2 \, \text{mm/rev}$. Each regrinding of the tool costs Rs. $20$. The time required for each tool change is $1 \, \text{min}$. Tool life equation is given as $VT^{0.2} = 24$ (where cutting speed $V$ is in $\text{m/min}$ and tool life $T$ is in $\text{min}$). The optimum tool cost per piece for maximum production rate is Rs. \ldots\ldots\ldots \ (round off to 2 decimal places). \hfill (GATE ME 2020)

\item
A point `$P$' on a CNC controlled $XY$-stage is moved to another point `$Q$' using the coordinate system shown in the figure below and rapid positioning command (G00).

A pair of stepping motors with maximum speed of $800 \, \text{rpm}$, controlling both the $X$ and $Y$ motion of the stage, are directly coupled to a pair of lead screws, each with a uniform pitch of $0.5 \, \text{mm}$. The time needed to position the point `$P$' to the point `$Q$' is \ldots\ldots \ minutes (round off to 2 decimal places). \hfill (GATE ME 2020)

Based on the total cost minimization criteria, the maximum inventory reached in the system is \ldots\ldots \ (round off to nearest integer). \hfill (GATE ME 2020)

The atmospheric pressure is $100 \, \text{kPa}$ and the initial pressure of air in the cylinder is 105 kPa. The area of piston is $300 \, \text{cm}^2$. Heat is now added and the piston moves slowly from its initial position until it reaches the stops. The spring constant of the linear spring is $12.5 \, \text{N/mm}$. Considering the air inside the cylinder as the system, the work interaction is \ldots\ldots \ J (round off to the nearest integer). \hfill (GATE ME 2020)

\item
Moist air at $105 \, \text{kPa}$, $30^\circ$C and $80\%$ relative humidity flows over a cooling coil in an insulated air-conditioning duct. Saturated air exits the duct at $100  \,\text{kPa}$ and $15^\circ$C. The saturation pressures of water at $30^\circ$C and $15^\circ$C are $4.24 \, \text{kPa}$ and $1.7 \, \text{kPa}$ respectively. Molecular weight of water is $18 \, \text{g/mol}$ and that of air is $28.94 \, \text{g/mol}$. The mass of water condensing out from the duct is \ldots\ldots \ g/kg of dry air (round off to the nearest integer). \hfill (GATE ME 2020)

\item
In a steam power plant, superheated steam at $10 \, \text{MPa}$ and $500^\circ$C, is expanded isentropically in a turbine until it becomes a saturated vapour. It is then reheated at constant pressure to $500^\circ$C. The steam is next expanded isentropically in another turbine until it reaches the condenser pressure of $20 \, \text{kPa}$. Relevant properties of steam are given in the following two tables. The work done by both the turbines together is \ldots\ldots \ kJ/kg (round off to the nearest integer). \hfill (GATE ME 2020)
