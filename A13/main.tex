    \item The new cotton technology, Bollgard-II, with herbicide tolerant traits has developed into a thriving business in India. However, the commercial use of this technology is not legal in India. Notwithstanding that, reports indicate that the herbicide tolerant Bt cotton had been purchased by farmers at an average of Rs 200 more than the control price of ordinary cotton, and planted in 15\% of the cotton growing area in the 2017 Kharif season.

    Which one of the following statements can be inferred from the given passage?  \hfill (CE 2019)

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Farmers want to access the new technology if India benefits from it
        \item Farmers want to access the new technology even if it is not legal
        \item Farmers want to access the new technology for experimental purposes
